This project is more than just a school assignmentâ€”it's a fully functional platform where users can rent bikes, sports equipment, and gaming consoles easily and securely. From designing the user interface to building the backend and managing the database, I developed every part of this application to demonstrate what I've learned and what I'm passionate about.<br />
My goal was to create a smooth and user-friendly rental experience while exploring real-world web development challenges. Whether you're looking to rent a bike for the weekend, borrow some gear for your next match, or enjoy a gaming night with friends, this platform has you covered.<br />
Thanks for visiting, and I hope you enjoy using the service as much as I enjoyed building it!</p>
